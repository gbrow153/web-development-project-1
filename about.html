        <p>Hello!.</p>
        <p>I'm Gigi Brown, an Interactive Design student at KSU. I've created this website with the intent to show off my HTML skills!</p>
        <p>I'm not very experienced with HTML, but I've realised I've actually used some of these HTML tags before when I had a DeviantArt account back then.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite colors is purple. So I tried to choose the prettiest shade from <a href="https://html-color.codes/">html-color.codes</a>. I hope you enjoy it. Some of my interests are writing, drawing, and listening to music. I'm also a real big fan of the gothic visual style.</p>

        <p>As a design student, I've gotten to work on designing prototypes for desktop websites to mobile applications. My future goal is to become a UX designer, to be able to work with a team of designers as well as real users to create intuitive designs that are just as easy to use as they are to look at. â™¡</p>
